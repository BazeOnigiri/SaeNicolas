# Commercial Management Application (SAE Nicolas)

This is a desktop application project developed in C# (WPF) with data persistence managed by a PostgreSQL database (using Npgsql).

The software provides full commercial management capabilities, covering wine inventory, clients, suppliers, and handling demand and order tracking.

It features a robust, modular architecture incorporating User Controls (UI views), business classes for CRUD operations, and unit tests.

The primary objective was to demonstrate proficiency in developing heavy desktop applications connected to a relational database.
